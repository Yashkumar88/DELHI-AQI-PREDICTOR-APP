
DATA  DICTIONARY 

AQI OF DELHI  - 2021 – 2023 

Here’s a simple and student-friendly explanation of each column in your dataset. This explanation can help students understand the relevance and purpose of the data:

1.From Date:  This is the starting time when the air quality data was collected. It helps us understand when the measurement period began.

2.To Date:    This is the ending time for the data collection. Together with "From Date," it tells us the time range for each measurement.

3.Ozone:      The amount of ozone (O₃) in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³). Ozone is a key air pollutant that impacts both human health and the environment.

4.CO:        Carbon Monoxide levels in the air, measured in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m³). High levels can come from vehicle emissions and industrial processes, making it a critical pollutant to monitor.

5.SO2:       Sulphur Dioxide concentration in the air, measured in µg/m³. This pollutant often comes from burning fossil fuels and can cause respiratory issues.

6.NO2:       Nitrogen Dioxide concentration, measured in µg/m³. It's an indicator of pollution from vehicles and industrial activities. NO2 also contributes to smog formation.

7.PM10:      Particulate matter (dust particles) with a size of 10 micrometres or smaller, measured in µg/m³. These particles can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat.

8.PM2.5:     Very fine particulate matter (smaller than 2.5 micrometres), also measured in µg/m³. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause serious health issues, like asthma and heart disease.

9.State:     The name of the state where the air quality measurement was taken. This helps in analysing how pollution varies across different regions.

10.City:     The name of the city where the air quality station is located. It provides more localized data for specific urban or rural areas.

11.Station: The specific monitoring station where the data was recorded. This helps pinpoint the exact location of the measurements and allows for micro-level analysis.

Why Is This Data Important?
•	The date and time columns help us analyse trends over time and understand when pollution levels are high.
•	The pollutant columns (Ozone, CO, SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5) provide insights into the air quality and health impacts.
•	The location columns (State, City, Station) allow us to compare pollution levels across regions and identify hotspots.
This dictionary gives students a clear idea of what the dataset contains and how each column contributes to understanding air quality.




AQI (Air Quality Index) in Delhi


The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi often ranges from "Moderate" to "Hazardous",
 depending on the time of year, weather conditions, and pollution sources. 
During the winter months, 
AQI frequently crosses the "Severe" level, primarily due to industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, construction dust, and crop residue burning in neighboring states.

Common Gases and Pollutants in Delhi's Air
The air in Delhi contains a mix of the following pollutants:

Ozone (O₃)

Ground-level ozone forms when pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight.
Causes respiratory problems and throat irritation.
Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Primarily emitted from vehicular emissions and incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
Reduces oxygen supply in the bloodstream and can be fatal in high concentrations.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)

Emitted from power plants, industrial processes, and burning coal or diesel.
Contributes to acid rain and irritates the respiratory system.
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)

Produced from vehicles, power plants, and burning of fossil fuels.
Contributes to the formation of smog and acid rain.
Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10)

Fine particles (PM2.5) and coarse particles (PM10) come from construction dust, vehicular emissions, and crop burning.
Penetrates deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Ammonia (NH₃)

Emitted from agricultural activities and waste management.
Reacts with other pollutants to form secondary particulates.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

Released from industrial processes, vehicular exhaust, and household products.
Contribute to the formation of ozone and smog.


Key Insights

M2.5 and PM10 are the most critical pollutants, as they remain suspended in the air for long durations and pose severe health risks.
The interaction of pollutants, such as NO₂ and VOCs, with sunlight worsens air quality by creating ground-level ozone.
